ADHI,"Dryland Organic Farming Partially Offsets Negative Effects of Highly Simplified Agricultural Landscapes on Forbs, Bees, and Bee-Flower Networks",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,2019,"Adhikari, S; Burkle, LA; O'Neill, K; Weaver, DK; Delphia, CM; Menalled, F","Industrialized farming practices result in simplified agricultural landscapes, reduced biodiversity, and degraded species-interaction networks. Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).",10.1093/ee/nvz056,3 years,"MT, USA (42.03°N, 110°W)",Pan traps,Species richness,1,Winter wheat,Cereal,Dryland,Center,field,1,Bees,F
BAKK,"Sweep netting samples, but not sticky trap samples, indicate beneficial arthropod abundance is negatively associated with landscape wide insecticide use",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2022,"Bakker, L; Werf, W; Bianchi, FJJA","Insecticide use and landscape context are major drivers for the abundance of beneficial arthropods, such as predators, parasitoids and pollinators. However, the relative importance of local and landscape-wide insecticide use is not well understood, and it is unclear to what extent impacts of insecticides on beneficial arthropod populations are moderated by landscape composition. We collected and analysed data on beneficial arthropod abundance and local and landscape-wide insecticide use across 38 Dutch landscapes. We used regression to study the associations between beneficial arthropod abundance (response), insecticide use and landscape factors. Insects were sampled by sweep netting and yellow sticky traps in field margins ('sampling sites') in the summer of 2017 and 2018. We paired organic and conventional sites in the same landscape setting. We used three indicators of insecticide use: management (organic vs. conventional), Treatment Frequency Index of insecticides applied in the field adjacent to the sampling site, and the estimated landscape-wide average quantity of insecticides applied per ha within a 1 km radius around the sampling site. Abundances of beneficial arthropods in field margins, assessed by sweep netting, were negatively associated with the estimated quantity insecticide applied in the surrounding landscape, while arthropod sampling by sticky traps did not show this relationship. Pollinator abundance was negatively associated with conventional management and with the frequency of insecticide applications in the adjacent field, while predator and parasitoid abundance did not show significant associations with local insecticide use indicators. Negative impacts of insecticide use were not moderated in more diverse landscapes with higher proportions of semi-natural habitats. Policy implications. Insecticide impacts on arthropod populations extend beyond the fields in which they are used. Awareness of the potential landscape-wide effects of pesticides, either through drift of pesticides or insect movement, may encourage land managers to adopt practices to reduce insecticide drift and the frequency of insecticide applications, thereby reducing the impacts of landscape-wide exposure on arthropods that provide services to agriculture. Risk assessments of insecticides and pesticide use regulations need to account for potential spill-over effects and consider landscape-scale consequences associated with the source-sink dynamics of arthropods.",10.1111/1365-2664.14106,2 years,"Netherlands (52.13°N, 5.29°E)",Transects,n/a,1,Varied,Varied,Gradient,Margin,farm,1,Pollinators,n/a
BOUT,The Value of Woody Hedgerows for Moth Diversity on Organic and Conventional Farms,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,2011,"Boutin, C; Baril, A; Mccabe, SK; Martin, PA; Guy, M","Habitat destruction and degradation are important drivers of biodiversity loss within agro-ecosystems. However, little is known about the effect of farming practices and the value of woody hedgerows on Lepidoptera in North America. The purpose of this work was to study moth diversity in woody hedgerows and croplands of organic and conventional farms. In addition, the influence of vegetation composition and abiotic variables on species richness, abundance, and composition was examined. Moths were sampled with light traps during six weeks in the summer of 2001. Vegetation data and abiotic variables were obtained for all sites. In total, 26,020 individuals from 12 families and 408 species were captured. Most species were uncommon. Only 35 species included >100 individuals while for 71% of species <10 individuals were found. The Noctuidae represented 221 species and 85% of all individuals captured. Woody hedgerows harbored more species and in greater number than croplands. There was no significant difference in moth diversity between organic and conventional farms, except that the Notodontidae were significantly more species rich in organic than in conventional sites. Results show that species richness, abundance, and composition were greatly influenced by habitat types (hedgerow versus crop field) and abiotic variables (minimum temperature which was correlated to moon illumination, rainfall, and cloud cover). Moth species composition was significantly correlated to vegetation composition. This study broadens our understanding of the factors driving moth diversity and expands our knowledge of their geographic range. The maintenance of noncrop habitats such as woody hedgerows within agro-ecosystems seems paramount to preserving the biodiversity and abundance of many organisms, including moths.",10.1603/EN10105,6 weeks ,"Ontario, Canada (44.2°N, 78.4°W)",Light Traps ,Species richness,1,"Mixed fruit, vegetable, legume, and winter wheat",Mixed,Mixed crop farming with pasture and woodlots ,Center and margin,farm,1,Moths,"t, r"
BRIT,Organic farming in isolated landscapes does not benefit flower-visiting insects and pollination,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,2010,"Brittain, C; Bommarco, R; Vighi, M; Settele, J; Potts, SG","Organic farming has often been found to provide benefits for biodiversity, but the benefits can depend on the species considered and characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In an intensively farmed area of Northeast Italy we investigated whether isolated organic farms, in a conventionally farmed landscape, provided local benefits for insect pollinators and pollination services. We quantified the relative effects of local management (i.e. the farm system), landscape management (proportion of surrounding uncultivated land) and interactions between them. We compared six organic and six conventional vine fields. The proportion of surrounding uncultivated land was calculated for each site at radii of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. The organic fields did not differ from the conventional in their floral resources or proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. Data were collected on pollinator abundance and species richness, visitation rates to, and pollination of experimental potted plants. None of these factors were significantly affected by the farming system. The abundance of visits to the potted plants in the conventional fields tended to be negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. The proportion fruit set, weight of seeds per plant and seed weight in conventional and organic fields were all negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. In vine fields the impact of the surrounding landscape was stronger than the local management. Enhancement of biodiversity through organic farming should not be assumed to be ubiquitous, as potential benefits may be offset by the crop type, organic-management practices and the specific habitat requirements in the surrounding landscape.

CLOU,Alpha and beta diversity of arthropods and plants in organically and conventionally managed wheat fields,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2007,"Clough, Y; Holzschuh, A; Gabriel, D; Purtauf, T; Kleijn, D; Kruess, A; Steffan-Dewenter, I; Tscharntke, T","1. Most studies in applied ecology use measures of alpha-diversity measures, i.e. the mean diversity on a site, to compare biodiversity effects of different management schemes. The total or alpha-diversity within a region, however, need not be correlated with the mean alpha-diversity within any site of the region. Thus, analyses of alpha-diversity alone may misrepresent the contributions of other diversity components (beta) to total diversity (gamma). 2. We apply a biodiversity-partitioning approach to species richness from a comparison between paired organic and conventional wheat fields in 21 sites from three regions in Germany, where we recorded plants, bees, carabids, staphylinids and spiders in the centre and edge of the fields. 3. Relative values of alpha- and beta-diversity depended on taxon. Both between-site and between-region beta-diversity were very high (in total 60-85%). alpha-Diversity and between-site beta-diversity was larger on the edge than in the centre of fields for all taxa. 4. alpha-Diversity, between-site beta-diversity of plants and bees and between-region beta-diversity of bees were higher in organic than in conventional fields, providing local as well as larger-scale species richness benefits. alpha-Diversity did not differ between management types for the epigaeic arthropods. Lower between-site beta-diversity was found for spiders in organic fields than in conventional fields, resulting in higher total species richness in conventionally managed wheat. 5. Similarity in composition of landscapes surrounding the study fields was correlated with similarity in species composition for epigaeic arthropods in conventional fields. For this group of organisms the variability of landscapes in the sample contributed to increasing beta-diversity. 6. Synthesis and applications. Diversity accounts for the major part of species richness in agro-ecosystems. Implementing an agri-environment scheme such as organic agriculture may result in either an additional increase of total diversity, as could be shown for plants and bees, or in a decrease in total diversity as was the case for the spiders. Therefore, beta-diversity needs to be included in the evaluation of different management schemes for conservation. For plant and bees it is recommended to implement agri-environment schemes in contrasting landscapes and in different regions to maximize total species richness benefits.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01294.x,3 months,"Germany (51.58°N, 08.17°E)",Transects ,"Alpha/Beta diversity, species richness",0,Winter wheat,Cereal,"Intensive, arable-dominated with some diversified areas ",Edge and center ,field,1,Bees,F
EKRO,Role of organic and conventional field boundaries on boreal bumblebees and butterflies,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2008,"Ekroos, J; Piha, M; Tiainen, J","This study examined how field boundary habitat quality and farming system (organic or conventional) affect species richness and abundance of diurnal lepidopterans and bumblebees in boreal agricultural landscapes. The results showed positive effects of field boundary area on lepidopteran diversity, as well as positive effects of nectar flower abundance on lepidopterans and bumblebee abundance. Organic farming did not show any significant effects on lepidopteran diversity. The results suggested that a successful conservation strategy for lepidopterans occurring in boreal agroecosystems depend on proper management of field boundaries, irrespective of farming regime. As bumblebee diversity tended to be higher at organic plots it is concluded that these important pollinators might be able to react on even small changes in habitat quality of cultivated lands. The results concord with a general hypothesis that effects of organic farming might be overpowered by effects of landscape structure in heterogeneous landscapes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

FEBE07,A comparison of butterfly populations on organically and conventionally managed farmland,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,2007,"Feber, RE; Johnson, PJ; Firbank, LG; Hopkins, A; Macdonald, DW","Habitat loss and reduction in quality, together with increasing homogeneity of the farmed landscape and more intensive field management, are believed to be major drivers of biodiversity loss on farmland. Organic farms demonstrate features that are now rare elsewhere in UK farming systems, such as crop rotations incorporating grass leys, exclusion of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and reliance on animal and green manures. They may also contain greater densities of uncropped habitats such as hedgerows. In this study, we examined whether organic farming affected populations of one group of insects of conservation interest, butterflies, on farmland. The abundance of butterflies on pairs of organically and conventionally managed farms was recorded over 3 years and a number of habitat and crop variables, likely to be related to butterfly abundance, were also measured. Organic farms attracted significantly more butterflies overall than conventional farms. Significantly more butterflies in both farming systems were recorded over the uncropped field margin than the crop edge. The difference in butterfly abundance between crop edge and field margin was relatively greater in conventional than organic systems. Species richness of butterflies tended to be greater on organic farms. Five species of butterfly were significantly more abundant on organic farms in at least 1 year, while no species was significantly more abundant on conventional farms. Organic and conventional cropping patterns differed, the former having proportionally more grass leys, and hedgerows were larger on organic farms. Although no significant effects of farming system on the numbers of grass or forb species present in the field margin or crop edge were detected, some individual plant species showed differences in frequency between organic and conventional field boundaries. Increasing the extent of organic farming, or practices associated with it, could help to restore biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.",10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00296.x,3 years,"England (51.76°N, 01.25°W)",Transects,Species richness,1,Arable or mixed,Mixed,n/a,Center and margin,farm ,1,Butterflies ,F

In both years, significantly more non-pest butterflies were recorded on organic than on conventional farmland, and more non-pest butterflies were recorded over the uncropped boundary habitat than over the crop edge habitat in both systems. By contrast, there was no significant difference in either year in the abundance of two pest species, Pieris brassicae (the large white) and Pieris rapae (the small white) between the two systems.

FORR,Contrasting patterns in species and functional-trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2015,"Forrest, JRK; Thorp, RW; Kremen, C; Williams, NM","Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California agroecosystem. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life-history (functional') traits for each species. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities.Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.

GABR,Food production vs. biodiversity: comparing organic and conventional agriculture,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2013,"Gabriel, D; Sait, SM; Kunin, WE; Benton, TG","A substantial proportion of the global land surface is used for agricultural production. Agricultural land serves multiple societal purposes; it provides food, fuel and fibre and also acts as habitat for organisms and supports the services they provide. Biodiversity conservation and food production need to be balanced: production needs to be sustainable, while conservation cannot be totally at the expense of crop yield. To identify the benefits (in terms of biodiversity conservation) and costs (in terms of reduction in yields) of agricultural management, we examined the relationship between crop yield and abundance and species density of important taxa in winter cereal fields on both organic and conventional farms in lowland England. Of eight species groups examined, five (farmland plants, bumblebees, butterflies, solitary bees and epigeal arthropods) were negatively associated with crop yield, but the shape of this relationship varied between taxa. It was linear for the abundance of bumblebees and species density of butterflies, concave up for the abundance of epigeal arthropods and butterflies and concave down for species density of plants and bumblebees. Grain production per unit area was 54% lower in organic compared with conventional fields. When controlling for yield, diversity of bumblebees, butterflies, hoverflies and epigeal arthropods did not differ between farming systems, indicating that observed differences in biodiversity between organic and conventional fields are explained by lower yields in organic fields and not by different management practices per se. Only percentage cover and species density of plants were increased by organic field management after controlling for yield. The abundance of solitary wild bees and hoverflies was increased in landscapes with high amount of organic land. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that considerable gains in biodiversity require roughly proportionate reductions in yield in highly productive agricultural systems. They suggest that conservation efforts may be more cost effective in low-productivity agricultural systems or on non-agricultural land. In less productive agricultural landscapes, biodiversity benefit can be gained by concentrating organic farms into hotspots without a commensurate reduction in yield.",10.1111/1365-2664.12035,2 years ,"England (52.36°N, 1.22°W)","Transects, triplicate traps",Species richness,1,Winter cereal ,Cereal,Dominated by approximately arable land and improved grassland ,Margin ,field,1,"Bumblebees, solitary bees, butterflies, hoverlies ",(GAMM)

In Europe, measures introduced to counteract these losses include those considered agronomically productive, such as organic farming, as well as those that support no direct production of crops, such as non-crop flowering fields in conventional farming systems. We studied biodiversity effects of non-productive flowering fields managed under conventional farming compared to both an organically managed cereal mono-crop (organic winter spelt fields) and a flowering mixed-crop (organic lentil mixed-crop fields) as well as conventionally managed winter wheat fields, which served as control crop. These four crop-use types were studied on six sites over 3 years (17 sites in total) to assess their impact on the activity density (cover for plants), species richness and community composition of wild plants, carabids, spiders, butterflies and wild bees. Species richness of wild plants was highest under organic farming and at field edges when compared to the interior. In the case of carabids and spiders, species richness was highest at the field edges, but there was no difference between the four crop-use types. In contrast, activity density and species richness of butterflies and wild bees responded only to flowering crop-use types, showing no edge effects. Arable land cover in 500 m buffer area also affected community composition of all taxa, with the exception of spiders, but had only minor effects on activity densities and species richness. Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline that there is no single best measure to promote biodiversity on arable land. Instead a mosaic of non-productive and productive measures such as conventional flowering fields, organic crops and field edge habitats might be more appropriate to support the regional species pool in arable-dominated landscapes. To support a range of complementary biodiversity-promoting farming practices, agricultural policy should foster the coordination and collaboration between multiple farmers within the same region by covering additional costs for coordination and prioritizing collaborative schemes.",10.1111/1365-2664.13851,3 years ,"SW Germany (48.53°N, 09.4°E)",Transects ,Species richness,0,"C- Wheat, flowering field; O- spelt, lentils",Cereal,Arable-dominated homogeneous to heterogeneous landscape gradient ,Edge and center ,field ,1,"Bees, butterflies  ","t, z"
GEPP,Agri-environment schemes enhance pollinator richness and abundance but bumblebee reproduction depends on field size,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2020,"Geppert, C; Hass, A; Foldesi, R; Donko, B; Akter, A; Tscharntke, T; Batary, P","Pollinators have experienced a dramatic decrease world-wide due to agricultural intensification. In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",10.1111/1365-2664.13682,4 months,"NW Germany (51.53°N, 09.94°E)",Transects + sweep nets ,Species richness,1,Winter wheat,Cereal,Simple agricultural lanscapes with low semi-natural habitat,Edge ,field ,1,"Bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies ",z
GODE,Effects of organic farming on plant and butterfly functional diversity in mosaic landscapes,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2019,"Goded, S; Ekroos, J; Azcarate, JG; Guitian, JA; Smith, HG","Organic farming can benefit plants and butterflies in terms of species richness and abundance, in particular in homogeneous landscapes. Nevertheless, whether organic farming can benefit functional diversity of these two organism groups is not well understood. Organic farming could benefit functional diversity by counteracting simplification and homogenisation of biotic communities caused by earlier agricultural intensification, and therefore contribute to communities more resilient to environmental or land use changes. We analysed species richness and four functional diversity indices (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of plants and butterflies on 15 pairs of organic/conventional farms in North-West Spain, whilst accounting for independent and joint effects of landscape context. To better understand links between functional diversity and taxonomic species assemblages, we applied an indicator species analysis to determine whether any particular plant or butterfly species were significantly more abundant on organic or conventional farms. Both butterfly species and functional richness were higher on organic than on conventional farms. In addition, when the farms were surrounded by low proportions of agriculture, butterfly functional evenness was higher on organic farms. In contrast, organic farming did not affect plant species richness or functional diversity. Nevertheless, plants were affected by landscape openness and field size, so that plant functional richness decreased with increasing landscape openness while functional evenness showed a complex relationship to the interaction between field size and landscape openness. Indicator analyses revealed that three plant species, but no individual butterfly species, were significantly related to organic farming. In conclusion, organic farms provide higher-quality habitat for butterflies than conventional farms, either by promoting specific grassland plants benefiting butterflies, or more generally by providing a wider niche space, fostering functionally diverse butterfly communities.",10.1016/j.agee.2019.106600,1 year,"Galicia, Spain (42.75°N, 07.93°W)",Transects,"Species richness, functional richness",1,Wheat pasture ,Cereal,"mosaic, 45% forest",Center,farm,1,Butterflies,F

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture.

Agri-environment schemes promote organic farming in an attempt to reduce the negative effects of agricultural intensification on farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination. Farming system, landscape context and regional differences may all influence biodiversity, but their relative impact and possible interactions have been little explored. 2. The study was performed in three regions (150 km apart, 400-500 km(2) per region) differing in land use intensity. Within each region, seven pairs of conventionally and organically cultivated wheat fields (mean size 4 ha, 42 study fields) were selected to encompass a gradient from heterogeneous to homogeneous landscapes within a 1-km radius around each field. 3. Farming system had the greatest influence on biodiversity. Higher bee diversity, flower cover and diversity of flowering plants were recorded in organic compared with conventional fields. Bee diversity was related both to flower cover and diversity of flowering plants, suggesting plant-mediated effects of the farming system. 4. Differences in bee diversity between organic and conventional fields increased with the proportion of arable crops in the surrounding landscape, indicating that processes at the landscape level modified the effectiveness of organic farming in promoting biodiversity. Similar patterns for flower cover and diversity of flowering plants suggested that landscape effects on bee diversity were mainly resource-mediated. After statistically removing the variance explained by flower parameters, residual bee diversity increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity. 5. Bee diversity differed between the three regions, but the effects of farming systems and landscape context were independent of regional differences. 6. Synthesis and applications. Bee diversity in wheat fields was mainly influenced by farming system, but an understanding of local bee diversity needs to incorporate both landscape and regional perspectives. The consistency of the results in three regions provides a reliable basis for management decisions. Agri-environment schemes that promote organic farming in homogeneous landscapes where there are few remaining flower-rich habitats could have the highest relative impact. However, while organic farming could help to sustain pollination services by generalist bees in agricultural landscapes, other measures are required to conserve more specialized bee species in semi-natural habitats.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01259.x,< 1 year,"Germany ((LB- 51.53°N, 09.93°E); (LDB- 50.82°N, 08.77°E); (SB- 51.58°N, 08.12°E))",Transects,Species richness,1,Winter wheat,Cereal,(SB) intensive wheat and sugar beet agriculture; (LB) productive diverse agricultural landscape and intermittent hills; (LDB) grassland with minimal fields and intensive homogeneous agriculture ,Across system ,field,1,Bees,F
HOLZ10,"How do landscape composition and configuration, organic farming and fallow strips affect the diversity of bees, wasps and their parasitoids?",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2010,"Holzschuh, A; Steffan-Dewenter, I; Tscharntke, T","P>1. Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x,2 years ,"NW Germany (51.53°N, 09.93°E)",Trap nests ,Species richness,0,Winter wheat,Cereal,Intensive flat cropland alternating with less intensive hilly regions,Center and fallow strip,field ,1,"Bees, wasps ",F

This loss of biodiversity has created the need to develop methods of intensive cultivation that combine high yields with biodiversity conservation. One promising method in maize cultivation is intercropping with beans. The objective of this study was to determine whether maize-bean intercropping could increase insect biodiversity. We examined the activity density, species richness and Shannon diversity of bees and carabid beetles in pure and intercropped maize under both organic and conventional management. We collected carabid beetles using pitfall traps and bees by doing transect walks. The study was carried out in an agricultural landscape, on a set of 17 study sites. We found that intercropping leads to significant increases in bumblebee and honeybee activity as well as in bee species richness. Differences between pure and intercropped maize were dependent on the year of data acquisition and the management style. Solitary wild bee species activity was not significantly affected. Carabid activity density and carabid species richness also did not differ significantly between the cropping systems. We conclude that maize-bean intercropping can contribute to insect biodiversity conservation but its contribution is limited to bumblebees. Despite its relatively low contribution per hectare, maize-bean intercropping could have a surprisingly positive impact, as maize now covers large areas of German farmland. Potential exists to increase the biodiversity value of maize intercropping even further by using varied plant mixes.

Environmental changes may not always result in rapid changes in species distributions, abundances or diversity. In order to estimate the effects of, for example, land-use changes caused by agri-environment schemes (AES) on biodiversity and ecosystem services, information on the time-lag between the application of the scheme and the responses of organisms is essential. 2. We examined the effects of time since transition (TST) to organic farming on plant species richness and butterfly species richness and abundance. Surveys were conducted in cereal fields and adjacent field margins on 60 farms, 20 conventional and 40 organic, in two regions in Sweden. The organic farms were transferred from conventional management between 1 and 25 years before the survey took place. The farms were selected along a gradient of landscape complexity, indicated by the proportion of arable land, so that farms with similar TST were represented in all landscape types. Organism responses were assessed using model averaging. 3. Plant and butterfly species richness was c. 20% higher on organic farms and butterfly abundance was about 60% higher, compared with conventional farms. Time since transition affected butterfly abundance gradually over the 25-year period, resulting in a 100% increase. In contrast, no TST effect on plant or butterfly species richness was found, indicating that the main effect took place immediately after the transition to organic farming. 4. Increasing landscape complexity had a positive effect on butterfly species richness, but not on butterfly abundance or plant species richness. There was no indication that the speed of response to organic farming was affected by landscape complexity. 5. Synthesis and applications. The effect of organic farming on diversity was rapid for plant and butterfly species richness, whereas butterfly abundance increased gradually with time since transition. If time-lags in responses to AESs turn out to be common, long-term effects would need to be included in management recommendations and policy to capture the full potential of such schemes.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01989.x,3 months ,"Sweden (59.86°N, 17.64°E)",Transects ,Species richness ,1,Cereal,Cereal,Gradient from homogeneous agricultural to complex forested landscapes,Margin ,field,1,Butterflies ,(AIC)

Yet, little is known how confounding factors co-varying with the specific AES measures may affect species responses. Here, we quantify the influence of one such factor, the time since transition to organic farming, on moth diversity patterns. We found that species richness and abundance of moths were higher on new organic farms (years since transition <= 6) compared to old organic (>= 15 years) and conventional farms, indicating a transient diversity peak. This correlates with the abundance patterns of the weed Cirsium arvense, which also reached its highest densities on new organic farms. Weeds such as C. arvense constitute a notorious problem in organic farming. However, they also provide various resources for farmland biodiversity, and our results strongly suggest that the transient weed peak may be important in influencing the parallel peak among the moths. This stresses the problem in balancing out production and conservation values.

This functional group was chosen as there is concern worldwide over pollinator decline, particularly in regions of high levels of endemism of both flora and fauna such as the CFR. Species richness and abundance of bees and monkey beetles were sampled and compared between organic and conventional vineyards, with natural vegetation as reference habitat. Species richness of monkey beetles, but not the species richness of bees, benefited from organic compared to conventional vineyard management. Our findings support the hypothesis that the effects of landscape context and management may be taxon dependent. Monkey beetles have been suggested as strong indicators of disturbance. These beetles are among the most important pollinator guilds in the CFR, as they help to sustain the endemic vegetation of this region.

This study investigates the effect of organic versus conventional management on bee species richness and abundance in vineyards in Italy and South Africa both having a Mediterranean climate. In each country, six pairs of organic and conventional vineyards were studied in simplified and complex agricultural landscapes. A total of 433 bee individuals from 25 species and 1049 individuals from 15 species were recovered in pan traps from Italy and South Africa respectively. Bee abundance showed region specific response to the effects of vineyard management. Flowering plants and proportion of uncultivated land mediated differences in bee abundance. Higher flowering plant species richness and flower density were found in organic vineyards compared to conventional vineyards in South Africa but these flowering plant indices were not significantly different between the two vineyard management types in Italy.

KRAU,Decreased Functional Diversity and Biological Pest Control in Conventional Compared to Organic Crop Fields,PLOS ONE,2011,"Krauss, J; Gallenberger, I; Steffan-Dewenter, I","Organic farming is one of the most successful agri-environmental schemes, as humans benefit from high quality food, farmers from higher prices for their products and it often successfully protects biodiversity. However there is little knowledge if organic farming also increases ecosystem services like pest control. We assessed 30 triticale fields (15 organic vs. 15 conventional) and recorded vascular plants, pollinators, aphids and their predators. Further, five conventional fields which were treated with insecticides were compared with 10 non-treated conventional fields. Organic fields had five times higher plant species richness and about twenty times higher pollinator species richness compared to conventional fields. Abundance of pollinators was even more than one-hundred times higher on organic fields. In contrast, the abundance of cereal aphids was five times lower in organic fields, while predator abundances were three times higher and predator-prey ratios twenty times higher in organic fields, indicating a significantly higher potential for biological pest control in organic fields. Insecticide treatment in conventional fields had only a short-term effect on aphid densities while later in the season aphid abundances were even higher and predator abundances lower in treated compared to untreated conventional fields. Our data indicate that insecticide treatment kept aphid predators at low abundances throughout the season, thereby significantly reducing top-down control of aphid populations. Plant and pollinator species richness as well as predator abundances and predator-prey ratios were higher at field edges compared to field centres, highlighting the importance of field edges for ecosystem services. In conclusion organic farming increases biodiversity, including important functional groups like plants, pollinators and predators which enhance natural pest control. Preventative insecticide application in conventional fields has only short-term effects on aphid densities but long-term negative effects on biological pest control. Therefore conventional farmers should restrict insecticide applications to situations where thresholds for pest densities are reached.",10.1371/journal.pone.0019502,2 months,"Bayreuth, Germany (49.93°N, 11.57°E)",Transects ,Species richness ,1,Winter triticale,Cereal ,"Relatively heterogeneous rich in forest and agricultural land, with some grassland and permanent crops",Edge and center ,field ,1,Pollinators (Syrphidae + Lepidoptera),r

Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this free service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.",10.1073/pnas.262413599,2 years ,"CA, USA (38.68°N, 121.77°W)",Transects,Species richness,1,Watermelon ,Other,Intensity gradient with varying levels of isolation from nearby oak woodland and chaparral habitat,Edge,farm,1,Bees,F

Bees are the main pollinator group and their assemblages are threatened by agricultural intensification. This study aimed to compare the diversity and structuring of bee assemblages between organic and conventional agroecosystems and to evaluate the influence of landscape composition on bee abundance in the Pampa biome. The study was carried out on three organic and three conventional family farms. Sampling was performed during the summer using pan traps. Four sampling units were placed on each farm, of which three were placed in crop field areas and one in native forest remnants. The diversity profile showed no significant difference between agroecosystems. Species abundance distribution indicates fewer dominant species in the organic system, suggesting the positive influence of polyculture on assemblage structure. Bee composition was different between agroecosystems. Notably, the species composition of bees in the forest edge of conventional farms was quite similar to that found in the organic habitats, indicating the importance of forested environments as a refuge for bees in conventional systems. The landscape analysis showed that the increase in the proportion of crop field areas negatively influenced the abundance of bees. We suggest that the maintenance of a heterogeneous agricultural landscape and smallholdings, composed of native and semi-natural habitats and organic practices on family farms can help to provide diverse niches for wild bees in the Pampa, contributing to biodiversity conservation and supporting ecosystem processes, like pollination.",10.1080/00218839.2021.1888524,3 months ,"S.

We compared species numbers and abundance of bumblebees and birds, plus cover of flowers, between three farming systems in two regions of Estonia.

Environmentally friendly management practices in Estonia include diversified crop rotations, at least 15% of arable land (including rotational grasslands) under legumes, permanent grassland strips, protection of landscape elements, reduced applications of agrochemicals, etc. The two selected regions (North and South) differed in landscape structure, soil types and crop yields.

We studied plantbumblebee food webs to understand the effects of two agri-environmental schemes (AES, organic farming and environmentally-friendly management practice) vs. conventional farming as control group, landscape structure (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous landscapes) and seasonality (June, July, and August) interactions using Estonian AES monitoring data. In the summer of 2014, we observed foraging bumblebees (20 species) on 64 farms that varied in agricultural management and landscape structure, yielding a total of 2303 flower visits on 76 plant species. We found that both management practice and landscape structure influenced the generality (redundancy in the use of flower resources) of food webs. In homogeneous landscapes, environmentally-friendly management practices, including restrictions on the application of glyphosates, enhancement of bumblebee habitats, such as permanent grassland field margins, the allocation of a minimum of 15% of arable land (including rotational grasslands) to legumes, contributed to a higher number of visited plant species (generality) in July, whereas organic farming did so in August. Therefore, both environmentally-friendly and organic management practices are needed to support plantbumblebee food webs in agricultural landscapes. Food web generality and diversity (Shannon index) are affected by a significant interaction between landscape structure and seasonality: food web diversity varied in homogeneous landscapes between the three different survey months, whereas food webs were more diverse in heterogeneous landscapes. We did not find any significant interaction effect of management, landscape structure and seasonality on linkage density and vulnerability. A full list of the most visited plant species by bumblebees based on species-specific flower visitation was also assembled.

Our capacity to ensure the provision of ecosystem services (ES), the sustainability of agroecosystems and the efficiency of agri-environmental schemes (AES) relies on this knowledge. There is growing interest in how biodiversity and ES are affected by the interplay between landscape characteristics and agricultural management (e.g., intermediate landscape complexity hypothesis; ILCH). However, studies have typically focused on classical measures of community structure (e.g., species abundance, richness and biodiversity), tending to neglect the effects on the structure and stability of ecological networks and the increased risk of biotic homogenization (i.e., loss of beta-diversity). In this work, we use bee trap nests to sample pollen-solitary bee mutualistic networks in 9 pairs of olive groves under different management regimes (conventional vs. organic) in a landscape complexity gradient in southern Spain. We analyse the mutualistic networks at farm level to test the ILCH and study how agricultural practices and landscape complexity interact to affect the properties of these networks. We also explore the effects on spatial biotic homogenization by performing multivariate analyses of the composition and abundance of bee-plant communities and their pairwise interactions. The results show that solitary bee-plant networks have greater complexity and stability on organic olive farms embedded in relatively heterogeneous landscapes. Differences from conventional management were higher in landscapes of intermediate complexity but were non-significant on olive farms located in simpler landscapes. beta-diversity of bees, plants and their pairwise interactions was also greater on organic olive farms.

Pollination deficit (the difference between potential and actual pollination) and bee abundance were measured in organic, conventional, and herbicide-resistant, genetically modified (GM) canola fields (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in northern Alberta, Canada, in the summer of 2002. Bee abundance data were collected using pan traps and standardized sweep netting, and pollination deficit was assessed by comparing the number of seeds per fruit from open-pollinated and supplementally pollinated flowers. There was no pollination deficit in organic fields, a moderate pollination deficit in conventional fields, and the greatest pollination deficit in GM fields. Bee abundance was greatest in organic fields, followed by conventional fields, and lowest in GM fields. Overall, there was a strong, positive relationship between bee abundance at sampling locations and reduced pollination deficits. Seed set in B. napus increased with greater bee abundance. Because B. rapa is an obligate outcrossing species, the lack of pollination deficit in the organic (B. rapa) fields likely was due to the high bee abundance rather than a lower dependence of B. rapa on pollinators than B. napus canola. Our study illustrates the importance of wild bees to agricultural production and suggests that some agroecosystems may better sustain wild bee abundance, resulting in greater seed production.

Habitat area, composition and management on organic fields were likely to favor higher levels of biodiversity by supporting more numbers of species, dominance and abundance across most taxa. Overall organic hedgerows harbored larger biodiversity during both pre-harvest and post harvest period. Species richness, dominance and abundance of most taxa are lost after harvest in both conventional and organic fields due lack of habit, habitat and microclimate.

They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insect-flower interaction networks. 2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insect-flower interaction network size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland. 3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited. 4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group.

Hoverflies provide ecosystem services including pollination, pest regulation and waste decomposition, but not enough is known about how they are influenced by organic farming and landscape composition, and structure to effectively manage them in different landscapes. 2. By conducting transect walks and pan-trapping, we investigated how hoverfly abundance/richness were related to organic farming, floral abundance, land-use cover and hedgerows in nine pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland. 3. We found more flowers on organic farms which attracted more hoverfly species. Organic farming also increased hoverfly abundance and richness beyond the benefits from increased floral resources, indicating that other organic management practices benefit hoverflies. This was evident regardless of the surrounding landscape composition. 4. Hoverfly abundance and richness were most strongly related to land use within 4 km around sites, indicating the importance of large spatial scales. Homogenous grassland landscapes (i.e. high grassland cover) supported higher hoverfly abundance and richness, possibly because they contain abundant macrohabitats suitable for the proliferation of grassland hoverflies. Hedgerow structure was also important, with hoverfly abundances greater on sites surrounded by a higher total cover of hedgerows, but with lower total hedgerow lengths (i.e. greater hedgerow volumes) within 1 km. 5. Our findings illustrate complex relationships between hoverflies and local and landscape factors, and they contrast with previous findings for other pollinators. We encourage increased floral resources and organic farming as a means of conserving hoverflies in grassland systems. Future management of grassland hoverflies needs to account for large spatial scales and the possibility that hedgerows greatly impact hoverfly diversity in hedgerow-dominated landscapes.",10.1111/icad.12163,3 months,"Ireland (52.47°N, 8.16°W)",Transects + pan traps ,Species richness,1,"Legumes, pasture",Pasture,"Lowland permanent grassland with fertile soils, primarily dairy farming ",Across system,farm ,1,Hoverflies ,t

To gauge the effects of these management systems on biodiversity, communities of vascular plants, butterflies, moths and birds were studied in vineyards in the Priorat Appellation of Origin (Catalonia, NE Spain). Measurements inside plots (all four taxonomic groups) and in grass strips between crop lines (only butterflies and vascular plants) were taken in organically and non-organically treated vineyards. Crop treatment was found to have an important effect, stronger on the most sessile organisms. Organic farms hosted consistently richer communities of both vascular plants and butterflies, a trend that was also observed - albeit less significantly - in moths. The weaker response in this group was probably due to insufficient sampling. Birds, the most vagile of the surveyed taxa, showed no significant response to treatments. Grass strips acted in all cases as reservoirs of biodiversity and hosted richer assemblages. The current trend of placing vineyards on slopes without terracing should ensure the existence of uncultivated strips within the vineyards to enhance the biodiversity of these agroecosystems. As well, parameters such as altitude and urban surface area are important drivers of biodiversity in this region. Our results suggest that organic farming may contribute to halting the widespread decrease that is occurring in communities of butterflies and other insects in this region.",10.1016/j.agee.2017.04.005,2 years ,"NE Spain (41.13°N, 00.82°E)","Transects, light traps ",Species richness ,0,Vineyard,Perennial ,Topographically complex mediterranean landscape with intermittent vineyards,Butterflies- Edge; moths- center,plot,1,"Butterflies, moths ",z
ROSA,Natural enemies and pollinators in traditional cherry orchards: Functionally important taxa respond differently to farming system,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2020,"Rosas-Ramos, N; Baños-Picón, L; Tormos, J; Asís, JD","Some of the negative effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity can be counteracted by the implementation of practices typically associated with organic farming. The efficiency of key ecosystem services, such as natural pest control or pollination, depends on biodiversity and could determine agricultural productivity and food security. In terrestrial ecosystems, both land use and topographic features are important filters in shaping taxa distribution. It is essential to identify which factors significantly drive changes in populations in order to maximize the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods and to support the underlying services they provide across agroecosystems. Although traditional orchards are high nature value farming systems that maintain high levels of biodiversity, there is a lack of information on how organic farming affects these systems. We examined beneficial arthropod communities to disentangle the extent to which predators, parasitoids, and pollinators are shaped by local field management (organic vs. conventional management) and topographic features (hillside aspect, i.e. the orientation of the slope). In traditional cherry orchards in western Spain, beneficial arthropod communities were assessed by using a combination of different sampling methods. Our results show that communities differed between farming systems. Overall, dominant or most representative parasitoid and pollinator taxa benefited from organic management, whereas predators showed a more heterogeneous pattern in their abundances probably due to their varying responses to habitat characteristics. Topographic features, although being a factor for some of the studied groups, did not strongly affect beneficial arthropod communities. Our results indicate that, in traditional orchards, the effects of farming system on beneficial arthropods are not easily predictable. Due to the variability in habitat preferences found among different functionally important taxa, we highlight the importance of continuing to unravel the specific responses of beneficial arthropods to local management practices.",10.1016/j.agee.2020.106920,,"Cáceres, Western Spain (40.17°N, 5.83°W)",Transects,n/a,1,Cherry orchard,Perennial ,High local and landscape heterogeneity from traditional management of cherry orchards,Across system,farm,0,Bees,"t, z"
RUND06,The effect of organic farming on butterfly diversity depends on landscape context,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2006,"Rundlof, M; Smith, HG","The recent dramatic decline in farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural changes in the agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming is viewed as a more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European agri-environment schemes. However, the efficiency of agri-environment schemes to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes. We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity). Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes. An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable land (yield of spring barley, kg ha(-1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas. Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based agri-environment schemes to increase the amount of organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic agri-environment schemes.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01233.x,2 years ,"S Sweden (55.99°N, 13.60°E)",Transects ,Species richness,1,"Cereal, legume",Cereal,Heterogeneous mixed farmland and intensively farmed homogeneous farmland ,Margin,farm ,1,Butterflies,F
RUND08,Interacting effects of farming practice and landscape context on bumblebees,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,2008,"Rundlof, M; Nilsson, H; Smith, HG","Organic farming has been suggested to counteract declines in farmland biodiversity, but comparisons to conventional farming have produced variable outcomes. To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumblebee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

SIDE,Reduced crop density increases floral resources to pollinators without affecting crop yield in organic and conventional fields,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2021,"Sidemo-Holm, W; Carrie, R; Ekroos, J; Lindstrom, SAM; Smith, HG","Effective weed control in agricultural crop fields increases yields, but simultaneously reduces floral resources for pollinators because many weed species provide pollen and nectar. Consequently, efforts to enhance crop yields on organic farms by using effective weed control methods risk compromising positive effects of organic farming on pollinating insects. Thus, it is important to find management strategies that alleviate the trade-off between crop yields and flowering weeds on organic farms. We investigated the relationship between cereal yields, flowering weeds and bumblebees on organic and conventional arable land. We also investigated the potential of adjusting crop sowing density to benefit flowering weed species richness and floral resources to bumblebees without affecting crop yield. Floral resources and species richness of flowering weeds were higher in organic compared to conventional fields and were negatively related to crop yield in organic but not conventional fields (where the variation of floral resources and flowering weed species richness was comparatively low). Bumblebee species richness was higher in organic compared to conventional fields, and abundance was twice as high in organic as in conventional fields, but not significantly so. Yields in organic fields were two thirds of those in conventional fields. When simultaneously testing the effect of farming type (organic vs. conventional), crop yield and floral resources, only floral resources were related significantly to bumblebee abundance and species richness. A lower sowing density of the crop increased floral resources without negatively affecting crop yield. Synthesis and applications. We show that organic farming practices in cereals benefit bumblebees by allowing more flowering weeds, but at a cost in terms of lower yields. However, adjusting crop sowing density provides an opportunity to attain increased floral resources without negatively affecting crop yields. Thus, by increasing floral resources, adjusting crop sowing density may contribute to supporting high bumblebee densities, which in turn sustain pollination services to wild plants and insect-pollinated crops, such as oilseed rape and field beans, in agricultural landscapes. We suggest that sowing strategies have the potential to contribute to ecological intensification by supporting organisms that provide ecosystem services to agriculture.",10.1111/1365-2664.13887,4 months ,"S Sweden (55.99°N, 13.60°E)",Transects ,Species richness,1,"Barely, wheat, oat",Cereal,High agricultural land use in temperate climate,Center,field ,1,Bumblebees ,?2

Despite their importance, the way in which many driving factors affect specific bees or pollinators in specific regions remains unknown. Northern New England is one such place lacking detailed study. Accordingly, we collected bees from three different landscape types for three consecutive years in northern New England. 2 Annual, seasonal and landscape factor affects were examined. We found that season and landscape type significantly influenced the bee community. Bee abundance and species richness were highest during the warmer seasons. At the landscape scale, overall bee abundance and species richness were greatest in the organic farm landscapes and lowest in the meadow landscapes. 3 We also examined the bee community across multiple taxonomic levels: guild, family and species. Wild bee abundance varied significantly depending on the taxonomic level analyzed. Within genera, certain species had significantly higher abundances in meadow type landscapes, whereas other species had higher abundances in the organic or the conventional farm type landscapes. 4 These results support the need for more regionally and taxonomically specific studies on wild bees, their habitat requirements and the influence of environmental factors across agricultural and unmanaged landscapes.",10.1111/afe.12287,3 years,"NH, USA (43.24°N, 71.02°W)",Pan traps + sweep nets,Species richness,1,"C-apple, squash, melon; O-apple, strawberry, raspberry ",Perennial ,Surrounding forest,Across System *assumed,farm,0,Bees,?2
UZMA,Mutual and Opposing Responses of Carabid Beetles and Predatory Wasps to Local and Landscape Factors in Vineyards,INSECTS,2020,"Uzman, D; Entling, MH; Leyer, I; Reineke, A","Simple Summary The aim of this study was to contribute to closing knowledge gaps on managing vineyards and viticultural landscapes in order to support insect diversity and abundance. We studied two different groups of predating insects, carabid beetles and cavity-nesting wasps, in organically and conventionally managed vineyards in Germany. Effects of surrounding landscapes and vegetation structure within vineyards were evaluated. No differences in species richness and abundance of carabid beetles and cavity-nesting wasps were found between organic and conventional management. Enhanced vegetation cover was positively correlated with carabids and negatively with wasps. High covers of annual crops in the surrounding landscape led to fewer species and individuals of both groups. The results underline the importance of insect-friendly management, especially in intensely farmed landscapes. Preserving agro-biodiversity is one of the main means at the moment to counteract the global biodiversity crisis. Vineyard inter-rows offer vegetation covers which could function as foraging grounds for arthropods. Furthermore, organic management and enhanced landscape complexity often support biodiversity. Here, species richness and abundance of two groups of arthropod predators in vineyards were studied. Fifteen pairs of organically and conventionally managed vineyards were chosen along a gradient of landscape complexity in Rhine-Hesse, Germany. Carabid beetles were sampled using pitfall traps and cavity-nesting wasps with trap nests, respectively. Proportions of different land-use types surrounding the vineyards were calculated and inter-row vegetation cover was characterized. Species richness and abundances of both predator groups were not significantly affected by the management system. Likewise, increased cover of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape did not promote their diversity or abundance. Instead, the increasing cover of annual crops diminished both groups. Cavity-nesting wasps profited from dense inter-row vegetation cover, while carabids were disadvantaged. The results indicate that distinct taxa within the same trophic group can respond oppositely to vineyard management. Thus, inter-row vegetation management with densely and sparsely vegetated elements might be best to support predator diversity. Overall, our results suggest that organic viticulture alone is insufficient to assist the studied insect groups, and that other local and landscape management options are needed for their protection.",10.3390/insects11110746,1 year ,"Rhine-Hesse, Germany (49.85°N, 08.35°E)",Trap nests,Species richness,1,Vineyard,Perennial ,Fertile landscape characterized by intensive agriculture and viticulture ,Center,farm,1,Solitary wasps ,?2

We investigated the species richness of plants, butterflies, carabids, rove beetles and the diversity of spiders in cereal fields, leys (grass and clover crop) and semi-natural pastures at 16 farms in Central East Sweden. The farms were divided into eight pairs of one conventional and one organic farm to enable us to separate the effects of landscape and farm management on biodiversity. The pairing was based on land use, location, and landscape features. Species richness of different taxonomic groups was generally not correlated. There were no differences in species richness between the farming systems, except for carabids that had higher numbers of species on conventional farms. The species richness generally increased with landscape heterogeneity on a farm scale. Habitat type had a major effect on the species richness for most groups, with most species found in pastures and leys. The correlations between species richness and landscape variables on a farm scale, and not on a scale of multiple farms, identify farmers as the important decision-maker in conservation issues for these taxonomic groups.
